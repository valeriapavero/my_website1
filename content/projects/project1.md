title: About me
---

My name is Valeria Pavero and I was born and raised in Milan, Italy. I am of Swiss and Italian descent and completed my pre-university qualifications at the German School of Milan gaining a double diploma with the German Abitur and Italian Maturita Scientifica. 

I always had a interest for economics and current affairs, which is why I moved to London to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University College London. After completing my undergraduate studies, I worked for a year at the London Stock Exchange and recently enrolled in the London Business School to broaden my knowledge of Financial Analysis. 

As an individual I am extremely driven and motivated. I am a big believer that in life you should never stop learning, and if you do stop then itâ€™s time to change something about it. I also believe that the biggest source of learning is social interaction. Friends and family are my greatest source of happiness and strength, and I am very open to meet new people and create new long-lasting friendships. 

Besides my professional interests, I am an avid skier and have been skiing since the age of 2 both in the Italian and Swiss Alps. As a born and raised Italian, I am also a huge food and wine lover, and enjoy trying out new restaurants and cuisines.
